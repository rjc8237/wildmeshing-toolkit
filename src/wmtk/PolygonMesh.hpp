/**
 * Proposed Implementation of the General Polygonal Mesh Data Structure
 *
 * A general polygonal mesh is represented using tuples of a consistently oriented face, edge,
 * and vertex together with orientation-reversing switch vertex, switch edge, and switch face maps.
 *
 * Using the tuple structure, the global cid is a halfedge (equivalently, an edge with a normal
 * direction), and a local vid. The vertex index can be interpreted as the tip of the edge and is
 * thus equivalent to specifying a vertex of the edge as well as a direction, which together with
 * the normal direction specifies an orientation of the face. The local eid and local fid are both
 * set to default -1.
 *
 * The implementation is done using the standard halfedge operations, next and previous halfedge,
 * encoded as pairs of edge attributes (two per edge, one for each halfedge). Opp is inferred from
 * the pairing of halfedges into edges. The switch vertex, switch edge, and switch face operations
 * can then be implemented as simple combinations of next, prev, and opp along with the additional
 * operation of switching the vertex of the halfedge. Switching the vertex corresponds to switching
 * the orientation of the surface, so next becomes prev and vice versa.
 *
 * Note that halfedge only supports oriented surfaces. However, the oriented halfedge could easily
 * be extended to support nonorientable surfaces by adding an additional edge attributes to indicate
 * whether the two adjacent faces should be glued with consistent or anti-consistent orientation.
 *
 * The choice of halfedges directed with the local vertex index is natural for the given tuple
 * interface as the halfedge is a 1-simplex in the given face, and using halfedge allows for some
 * theoretical simplifications as well as more compact memory usage.
 *
 * Also note that the natural generalization of this implementation is the facet-edge data
 * structure of Dobkin and Laszlo, where the primitive is an oriented face-edge
 * triple. However, while the halfedge can be encoded as an edge attribute, the facet-edge
 * data needs to be encoded on actual pairs of faces and edges as each face can be incident
 * to many edges and vice versa.
